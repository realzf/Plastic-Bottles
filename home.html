    <h2>THE PLASTIC BOTTLE ISSUE</h2>
    <p><br>As humans have advanced through time, many injustices have come along the way.
       A major issue is about plastic. Every year billions of plastic items
       are produced and bought. Most these plastic products are a convenient and portable
       product but that convenience comes with a price and adds on some injustices.
       This includes environmental problems, how it affects humans, animals and
       many other problems. This site is trying to raise awareness about this problem
       specifically plastic water bottles.
    </p>

    <h2>POLLUTION</h2>

    <p>Firstly, plastic water bottles are made from crude oil. During production,
      many pollutants are released like nickel, benzene and ethylene oxide which
      harm the environment. After production, the vehicles that ship bottled water
      release more pollutants and use gasoline. Also, pollution is a major issue
      with this product. An example of this is how about 86% of empty plastic water
      bottles in the United States land in the garbage rather than recycling.
      Additionally, about 2.7 million tons of plastic is produced each year
      in America. Plastic bottles end up being incinerated and release many toxic
      byproducts such as chlorine gas. Furthermore, garbage dumps are usually
      located near the ocean and that is also where many bottles end up.
      Many animals in the ocean are affected by this as they can mistakenly
      take plastic as food. Eating plastic can kill animals like sea turtles,
      birds and jellyfish. Also, production harms aquifers and other ground
      water resources. This is a big injustice as harming the earth will
      have a negative impact in the end and can harm humans in unprecedented ways.

    <h2><br>THE WATER BUSINESS</h2>
    <p><figcaption>[3]</figcaption><img src="money.jpg"
       alt="corruption" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px; width: 500px;height:350px;"></p>
    <p>Secondly, worldwide consumption of bottled water is increasing every year
       and this growth is higher than any other beverage. Billions of liters of
       this product is sold each year, worth billions of dollars. An example of
       this is in Canada. Due to the availability of Canadaâ€™s water resources,
       they have big businesses in that industry and sell around 10% of the worldâ€™s
       fresh water each year. With this outstanding growth, no bottled water
       business wants their production stopped and oppose any action taken against
       it. Money is seen as the route taken over all the other issues like saving
       the environment, humans and animals.</p>

    <h2><br>HEALTH ISSUES</h2>

    <p>Many businesses portray that bottled
       water is healthier than tap water, however this is not the case. Bottled
       water affects public health. The water in a plastic bottle eventually
       mixes with toxins broken down due to the plastic. Once someone drinks
       this water, BPA and many other toxins can make their way to the
       consumerâ€™s blood stream. This can cause many health issues like many
       cancers and liver and kidney damage also as shown on the right. Furthermore
       during production and shipping of this product affect air quality
       many toxins released which is a major human need. Also, consumers rarely
       know where companies are getting the water in bottled water from, it might
       be from the tap or unclean water. This injustice is seen in
       many other sectors of the business world as well as the business
       is seemed more important than anything else.</p>

       <p>Due to those reasons, production of bottled water has many injustices,
          but there are many possible solutions to avoid it. An example is that
          reusable water bottles can be purchased as an alternative. Stainless
          steel or BPA free bottles are great options as they do not present
          any harm to human health. If this alternative is widely used, it will
          reduce all the injustices and harm bottled water creates for the
          world. Another solution can be to completely ban the use of all
          plastic items like straws, bottles, etc in particular areas like
          countries, cities and provinces. This would reduce the earnings
          of the businesses and eventually end these types of companies.
